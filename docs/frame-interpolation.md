# Frame interpolation: the mechanism

How `wiiuport` presents frames between two guest simulation ticks. This document owns
the mechanism. What any value *means* belongs to the consuming title.

## What the guest gives us

Guest GPU work reaches the runtime as **display lists in guest memory**. The command
processor sees `IT_INDIRECT_BUFFER` packets carrying a physical address and a size in
dwords, and walks the referenced buffer (`LatteCP_itIndirectBuffer`,
`LatteCP_processCommandBuffer`). A frame ends at `LatteRenderTarget_itHLESwapScanBuffer`,
which bumps `LatteGPUState.frameCounter` and calls `Renderer::SwapBuffers`.

Two consequences decide the whole design:

1. **A frame's draw stream is re-runnable.** It is data in memory, not a consumed
   stream, so the same frame can be issued a second time with different inputs.
2. **All uniform data for a draw is assembled in one place.** Whichever way the guest
   supplied it, `VulkanRenderer::uniformData_updateUniformVars` gathers it into a single
   buffer immediately before upload. That covers both of Latte's uniform modes:
   `FULL_CFILE`, where values come from the ALU constant registers that
   `IT_SET_ALU_CONST` wrote (inline in the display list), and `REMAPPED`, where they are
   loaded from uniform buffers in guest memory. Substitution happens there, on the
   assembled copy, after the guest's values have been read and before the GPU sees them.

## Where substitution happens, and why not in the display list

An earlier reading of the fork suggested patching the recorded display-list bytes
directly, because `IT_SET_ALU_CONST` carries its values inline. That is workable for one
of the two uniform modes and wrong for the other, and it would make the runtime care
about packet layout. Substituting at the assembly point instead is strictly better:

- it is one site rather than one per uniform mode;
- it never writes to guest memory, because it edits a buffer the runtime owns;
- it sees uniform-register and uniform-buffer values in the same form, so a consumer
  describes a transform once rather than once per path.

Recording the display lists is still needed — but only to *re-issue the draws*, not to
carry the substituted values.

### The exact site, read from the fork

`VulkanRendererCore.cpp` assembles uniforms in **two** functions, not one:

| function | line | used for |
|---|---|---|
| `VulkanRenderer::uniformData_updateUniformVars` | 375 | the full path |
| `VulkanRenderer::uniformData_updateUniformVarsIncremental` | 452 | the fast draw sequence |

Naming only the first would have repeated the display-list mistake at a different
layer: a title that mostly takes the fast path would have most of its draws pass
through unsubstituted. Both end on the same statement (lines 449 and 496):

```cpp
dynamicOffsetInfo.uniformVarBufferOffset[shaderStageIndex] =
    uniformData_uploadUniformDataBufferGetOffset({(uint8*)uniformBuf, shader->uniform.uniformRangeSize});
```

The hook is therefore one private helper taking `(shaderStageIndex, shader, uniformBuf)`,
called from both sites immediately before that upload. It is **not** placed inside
`uniformData_uploadUniformDataBufferGetOffset`, for two reasons: that function has no
`shader`, so it cannot know where anything lives in the buffer; and it has a third
caller at `VulkanRenderer.cpp:3264` which uploads Cemu's own output-shader uniforms,
which are not guest state and must never be blended.

### Where the values sit inside the assembled buffer

`shader->uniform` carries the layout, and the two modes land in the same buffer:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `loc_uniformRegister`, `count_uniformRegister` | the ALU-constant block, `count * 16` bytes |
| `loc_remapped` | the remapped uniform-buffer block |
| `uniformRangeSize` | total assembled size, and the span that gets uploaded |

One detail that is easy to get wrong: these `loc_` values are **byte** offsets, and the
function indexes floats with `uniformBuf + (index / 4)`. A substitution that treated
them as float indices would write at four times the intended offset and corrupt
unrelated state rather than fail visibly.

## Recording

Between two swaps, record every `IT_INDIRECT_BUFFER` the frame references as
`(physical address, dword count, copy of the contents)`. The copy is not an
optimisation to remove later: the guest reuses and overwrites that storage as soon as
the frame is submitted, so a reference alone would replay whatever the next frame wrote.

Alongside it, record the assembled uniform buffer of every draw, keyed by the draw's
position in the frame. Those recordings are what a consumer's blend reads: tick N-1's
assembled values and tick N's, for the same draw.

## Presenting

A title that runs at 30 Hz normally does so by setting `GX2SetSwapInterval(2)`, and
`LatteTiming_signalVsync` then flips only on every second vsync. The cadence is already
60 Hz; every second flip simply repeats the previous image. The first consumer was
measured doing exactly this (see `docs/issues/ISSUE-003-wwhd-swap-interval.md`).

Interpolation fills the repeat slot rather than adding presents:

1. On the vsync that carries a new guest frame, present it as today.
2. On the repeat vsync, replay the recorded stream instead of showing the duplicate.
   Each draw re-enters the uniform assembly site, where the consumer's blend of ticks
   N-1 and N is substituted into the assembled buffer. Present that.

The cost is one extra scene render per tick. The latency cost is the half-tick the blend
inherently needs, because a frame between N-1 and N cannot be drawn until N exists — not
an additional present on top of it.

For a title that flips at 60 Hz already, or at 30 Hz with an interval of 1, there is no
repeat slot to fill and the runtime must add a present instead. That case is not
implemented and is refused rather than approximated.

The obvious later optimisation — replaying only the passes that depend on the
substituted transforms and reusing the rest — is an optimisation, not the design. It is
only safe once the null-interpolation gate below holds for the full replay.

## The gate that comes before any blending

**Null interpolation.** With the blend forced to the identity at t=1, the replayed frame
must be byte-identical to the original. If it is not, the replay is not faithful and no
blended frame produced by it means anything. This runs before any transform is
identified, and it is the discriminator that proves the replay path is real rather than
merely not crashing.

The negative case must be legible: when a frame cannot be replayed, the runtime reports
*which* frame, *how many* buffers it had recorded, and *which* packet made it bail —
never a silent fall back to presenting at the guest's rate.

## What the runtime counts

Every run reports, with denominators: frames recorded of frames seen; frames replayed of
frames recorded; replay bailouts broken down by reason; transform slots substituted per
replayed frame. A run in which no frame was replayed fails its gate; it does not pass
quietly.

## What this mechanism will not do

It does not inspect rendered pixels, estimate motion from image content, sample adjacent
frames to decide what geometry exists, or blend state whose provenance across ticks is
not established. An object whose state cannot be matched to the same object in the
previous tick is replayed un-blended and counted, never blended against a different
object's state.

## Renderer scope

The assembly site above is the Vulkan renderer's. The runtime's interpolation is
therefore Vulkan-only, which is the backend the first consumer targets. The OpenGL
renderer keeps its ordinary behaviour and presents at the guest's rate; that is an
explicit limitation, not an oversight, and it is recorded as such in project state.
